<h1>Image paste Plugin for CKEditor</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a plugin that automatically uploads to the server the images pasted from the clipboard with Firefox, or with Drag&amp;drop in most current browsers in <a href="http://www.ckeditor.com">CKEditor</a>.</p>

			Fix problems in CKEditor 4 if setData is called on the editor<br>
			Use correct URL for upload if it lacks query string parameters.
			</li>
	<li>3.1: 4-May-2013 Adjusted the ACF for IE8 and IE9<br>
			The events have been renamed to "<a href='#startUpload'>imagepaste.startUpload</a>" and "<a href='#endUpload'>imagepaste.endUpload</a>" and now the startUpload can be used to cancel an upload</li>

	<li>3.2: 1-June-2013 Adjusted the regexp for detection of uploads to take care of systems that lack the status message.<br>
			Added a console warning if the upload url hasn't been set in the configuration of CKEditor.<br>

	<li>3.3.4: 5th-October-2013 New event "<a href='#finishedUpload'>imagepaste.finishedUpload</a>" that it's fired after the final element has been inserted into the page (so you can add for example your custom class or modify any other attribute)
	</li>
	<li>3.4 Support for <a href="#CORS">Cross domain requests</a>. Now you can upload your files for example to http://media.example.com and edit the page from http://admin.example.com.
</ol>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<h3>1. Copying the files</h3>
<p>Extract the contents of the zip in you plugins directory, so it ends up like
    this<br>
    <!--<img src="installation.png" alt="Screenshot of installation" width="311" height="346" longdesc="#install">-->
    </p>

</pre>
<h3>2. Adding it to CKEditor</h3>
<p>Now add the plugin in your <em>config.js</em> or custom js configuration
file:
<code>config.extraPlugins='imagepaste'; </code>
</p>

<h3>3. Configuration</h3>
<p>You have to configure the filebrowserImageUploadUrl and filebrowserUploadUrl entry as you might have already done to allow the user to upload files and images.</p>
<p>If you're using <a href="http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Paste+images+and+docs+right+into+Wiki+-+CKEditor">Liferay, check these detailed instructions</a></p>
<p id='cssConfig'>Since 2.7 it's possible to specify the shadows (or whatever CSS effects that you prefer) to use while a file is dragged over the page and an editor.<br>
The plugin detects those situations and adds/removes the "ImagePasteOverEditor" and "ImagePasteOverContainer" classes.<br>
Here "container" refers to the whole CKEditor including toolbar and whatever is part of the UI. This is always an element in the main page, so you can override it also in the page where you're using CKEditor (keep in mind that the plugin might add the rule defined in the configuration after your styles, so check the priority of the CSS rules if you can't get it to work that way.<br>
This is the default value:
<code><b>CKEDITOR.config.imagepaste_containerhover</b> = 'box-shadow: 0 0 10px 1px #99DD99 !important;'</code>
Important: the config is picked from CKEDITOR.config, this is a setting shared by all the editor instances. If you want to specify different settings for each editor container you must do it in your page.<br>
ex:
<code>
#cke_editor1.ImagePasteOverContainer {
	box-shadow: 0 0 10px 1px #99FF99;
}
#cke_editor2.ImagePasteOverContainer {
	border:2px solid black; // be careful, styling the container can be tricky to get a good efect
}
</code>

The second class is used when the user drags over an editor, in this case the behavior is different between CKEditor 3 and 4. In CKEditor 3 we're always using an iframe so this setting can be specified for each instance, but in CKEditor 4 due to the introduction of inline editing they've changed the way that addCss works so in a similar way to the previous setting this value is the same for all the instances, but you can easily override it in the styles of your page.<br>
Default value:
<code><b>CKEDITOR.config.imagepaste_editorhover</b> = 'box-shadow: 0 0 10px 1px #999999 inset !important;'</code>
You can add different configuration in the config.contentsCss file, or in v4 inline mode in the page itself:

<code>
// for v4 inline
#cke_editor1.ImagePasteOverEditor {
	box-shadow: 0 0 10px 1px #99FF99;
}
#cke_editor2.ImagePasteOverEditor {
	background-color: green;
}
</code>

</p>
<p>Since 3.0 there are two buttons that can be used to provide a single click to launch the file picker and add a file or image to the document.<br>
The name of such buttons are "addFile" and "addImage" if you want to add them to your toolbar. <br>
If you use CKEditor 4 they will be added automatically to the "insert" toolbar, if you don't want one or either of them, you can specify those names in a "removeButtons" entry in your config file:
<code>
config.removeButtons = "addFile"; // Removes the "add files" button and leaves the one to add images.
</code>
</p>
<p>
These buttons are available for all the browsers, including IE8 and IE9 but in this case it's using a trick to allow the single click browse and upload so it might fail
in some environments (I guess so, but I have no such data). I might try to fix such problems if you report back to me, but you must realize that I'm already forzing IE
to work in an unexpected way.<br>
Anyway, as usual with my plugins, IE6 and IE7 are not supported, nor pages in Quirks mode. It might work, but if it fails I can't try to fix things when the solution is to upgrade to a current browser or make your pages compliant with the standards.
</p>

<h3 id="events">4. Events</h3>
<p>The plugin generates three custom events so you can show a notification like in the demo page while a file is being uploaded.<br>
This is the signature of the methods:
<code>
 /**
 * Fired when file starts being uploaded by the "imagepaste" plugin
 * @name CKEDITOR.editor#<a name='startUpload'>imagepaste.startUpload</a>
 * @event
 * @param {String} [name] The file name.
 * @param {String} [url] The url that will be used for the upload. It can be modified to your needs on each upload.
 * @param {String|Object} [context] Context that caused the upload (a string if it's a pasted image, a DOM event for drag&amp;drop and copied files, the toolbar button for those cases)
 * @param {Object} [file] The file itself (if available).
  */

/**
 * Fired when file upload finishes on the "imagepaste" plugin
 * @name CKEDITOR.editor#<a name='endUpload'>imagepaste.endUpload</a>
 * @event
 * @param {String} [name] The file name.
 * @param {Boolean} [ok] Whether the file has been correctly uploaded or not
 */

/**
 * Fired when the final element has been inserted by the "imagepaste" plugin (after it has been uploaded)
 * @name CKEDITOR.editor#<a name='finishedUpload'>imagepaste.finishedUpload</a>
 * @event
 * @param {String} [name] The file name.
 * @param {CKEDITOR.dom.element} [element] The element node that has been inserted
 */
 </code>
</p>
<p>Since 3.1 it's possible to use the startUpload event to cancel the upload or change the URL where the file will be uploaded</p>
<code>
// Let's add this to every editor on the page. You can instead add it only to a specific editor.
CKEDITOR.on('instanceReady', function(e) {
	// the real listener
	e.editor.on( 'imagepaste.startUpload' , function(ev) {

		var name = ev.data.name;
		if ( (/\.rar$/i).test( name ) )
		{
			// Silly example
			alert("Rar files are outdated, please use 7-Zip");
			ev.cancel();
		}
	});
});
</code>
<p>The finishedUpload event introduced in 3.3.4 allows to modify the final element, for example removing the dimension attributes and adding our own class:
<code>
// Let's add this to every editor on the page. You can instead add it only to a specific editor.
CKEDITOR.on('instanceReady', function(e) {
	// the real listener
	e.editor.on( 'imagepaste.finishedUpload' , function(ev) {

		var element = ev.data.element;
		// remove dimension attributes added in v 3.3.2
		element.removeAttribute("width");
		element.removeAttribute("height");

		// add our custom class
		element.addClass("picture");

	});
});
</code>
<h3 id='CORS'>5. Cross domain file uploads</h3>
<p>In version 3.4 I've added support to upload files across domains. <br>
This is based on the  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP/Access_control_CORS ">CORS</a> spec. At the moment this won't work with IE < 10: IE8 doesn't support XHR uploads and IE9 requires the use of the custom XDomainRequest that also seems to be restricted about what it can do; I don't plan to work on those older versions of IE. </p>
<p>If you don't use cross domain (one server for the uploaded files and another for the editing page) then this change shouldn't affect you. Otherwise you can enable this feature by modifying your uploader to send just two headers in response to an OPTIONS request:
Some simple PHP code:
<code>
if (isset($_SERVER["HTTP_ORIGIN"])) {
	$origin = $_SERVER["HTTP_ORIGIN"];
	// Warning: this is not secure, it allows usage of the page from any domain.
	// You must verify that the $origin domain is on your white-list
	header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ' . $origin);
	header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true');
}
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']=='OPTIONS')
{
	exit(0);
}
</code>
First: check if the browser has sent an Origin header. That means that it's a cross domain request. You can check that domain with the list of domains that you want to allow, this sample code just repeats back the header so it allows any domain to call this page.<br>
Second: Send an Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header specifying that the browser is allowed to make a request that will use the credentials of the user at this domain. This means that if the user is logged in, the browser will send the cookies required to allow you check his/her identity.<br>
Last: as the OPTIONS request doesn't require more data in the response you can stop any further processing here. After this first request the browser will upload the file and you must send back the two Access-Control headers as shown in the sample code.</p>
<p>You must be careful if you want to allow this feature, after all it opens the possibility of another attack vector. If you're hosting the files in the same physical server, you might be able to get the same functionality by modifying just the URL that it's returned after you upload a file and keeping all your code in the  admin.example.com domain.</p>


<h3>6. Use it</h3>
<p>Using Firefox, paste an image into the body of CKEditor. That image will be uploaded to the server and it will use the correct URL instead of "data:".</p>
<p>With the rest of the browsers, you can drag & drop a file from your desktop and it will be inserted as an image or a link. <br>
Supported browsers (Current versions or latest beta):</p>
<ul>
	<li>Firefox</li>
	<li>Chrome</li>
	<li>IE 10</li>
	<li>Opera</li>
	<li>Safari</li>
</ul>
